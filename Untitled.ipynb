    "Numpy is the core library for scientific computing in Python. It provides a high-performance multidimensional array object, and tools for working with these arrays.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "A numpy array is a grid of values, all of the same type, and is indexed by a tuple of nonnegative integers. The number of dimensions is the rank of the array; the shape of an array is a tuple of integers giving the size of the array along each dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "## NumPy Random\n",
    "\n",
    "Numpy random is used to generate random sampling. An important part of any simulation is the ability to generate random numbers. For this purpose, NumPy provides various routines in the submodule random. It uses a particular algorithm, called the Mersenne Twister, to generate pseudorandom numbers."
